# Backup-Camera-Overlay
In this project, an overlay for a backup camera was created and includes lines to represent distances of 7ft, 10ft, and 15ft from the back of the vehicle. It also includes dynamic trajectory lines to assist the driver in determining the path of the vehicle at the maximum wheel angle.
